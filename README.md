# Kino_Demo
Demo of an alternative to Kinokuniya's current book inventory system.

After working part-time at Kinokuniya, I played around with the out of date book inventory system to create a more efficient one.
Program prompts user to enter a number corresponding to the menu items displayed:\n
1 - outputs books from an ArrayList in ascending order based on price

2 - allows user to add books into an ArrayList cart

3 - outputs items in the cart

4 - displays the total price from the items in the cart, then empties the cart ArrayList

5 - clears the cart ArrayList

6 - exits program
